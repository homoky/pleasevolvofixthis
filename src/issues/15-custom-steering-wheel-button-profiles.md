# Custom Steering Wheel Button - Multiple Profiles

## Current Issue

Currently, the custom steering wheel button can only be assigned one of three actions, and each action can only be toggled on/off. This is limiting for users who want to control multiple vehicle settings efficiently.

## Proposed Solution

Implement a "Custom Profiles" system with two configurable profiles:

### Custom Profiles

- **Single Press**: Activates Custom Profiles 1 (user-configurable combination of settings)
- **Long Press**: Activates Custom Profiles 2 (alternative user-configurable combination)
- **Subsequent Press**: Deactivates the currently active profile

### Configurable Settings Per Profile

Each Custom Profiles should allow users to configure combinations of:

- Steering feel/stiffness
- Speed limit warning
- Driver alert settings
- Ambient lighting
- One pedal drive mode
- Other relevant vehicle settings

### User Interface

- Settings menu to configure what each Custom Profiles includes
- Clear indication of which profile is currently active

## Benefits

- Eliminates need to repeatedly configure multiple settings (4-5 separate menu actions) that some users might typically adjust together at the start of each drive
- Improved driving comfort and overall driving experience
- Reduced driver frustration from repetitive menu navigation
- Improved user experience through reduced menu navigation
- More efficient control of multiple vehicle settings
- Personalized driving modes for different scenarios
- Better utilization of the existing custom button hardware
