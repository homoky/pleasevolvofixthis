title: "Proactive Speed Limit Adaptation - Change Speed Before Entering/Leaving Towns"

## Issue Description

The speed limit adaptation system currently changes the speed limit only when the vehicle enters or exits a town/village, causing abrupt speed transitions. For example, when entering a town, the limit changes from 90 km/h to 50 km/h exactly at the town entrance sign, and when leaving, it changes from 50 km/h to 90 km/h at the exit sign.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

- **Driver anxiety**: Drivers get startled when approaching a village because they see the speed limit will change but don't know when
- **Driver impatience**: When leaving towns, drivers become impatient and lose trust in the system's ability to update the speed limit in time
- **Forced manual intervention**: Drivers are forced to brake manually when entering towns at 90 km/h, which automatically disables the cruise control system to immediately reduce speed, because the system only starts braking at this moment
- **Abrupt speed changes**: The sudden speed limit changes create uncomfortable driving experience and potentially unsafe situations

## Proposed Solution

Implement proactive speed limit adaptation:

- **Before entering towns**: Reduce speed limit to 50 km/h approximately 200 meters before the town entrance
- **Before leaving towns**: Increase speed limit to 90 km/h approximately 100 meters before the town exit
- Utilize existing map data to predict upcoming speed limit changes and adjust accordingly

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

- **Smoother driving experience**: Gradual speed transitions instead of abrupt changes
- **Maintained cruise control**: No need for manual braking, keeping adaptive cruise control active
- **Improved driver confidence**: Drivers can trust the system to handle speed changes proactively
- **Enhanced safety**: Reduces risk of entering towns at excessive speeds
- **Better passenger comfort**: Eliminates sudden speed adjustments that can be jarring

## Negative Impact of Proposed Solution

- **Potential early warnings**: May occasionally slow down before reaching actual speed limit zones if map data is inaccurate
- **Increased system complexity**: Requires more sophisticated prediction algorithms and reliable map data
- **Battery consumption**: Additional processing for predictive speed management may slightly impact energy efficiency
