title: "Climate Control - Rearview Mirror Heating Control"

## Issue Description

The climate control system lacks a dedicated option to manually control the heating of rearview mirrors. Users cannot find a way to turn on mirror heating, and if it's activated automatically during general heating, users are unaware of this functionality. There is no clear indication or separate control for this feature.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

- **Lack of control**: Users cannot manually activate mirror heating when needed (e.g., during light frost or condensation)
- **Unknown functionality**: If mirror heating works automatically, users don't know when it's active or how to control it
- **Missed functionality**: During conditions where only mirror heating is needed (not full cabin heating), users cannot access this specific feature

## Proposed Solution

Add a separate button or control option for rearview mirror heating in the climate control interface. This could be implemented as:

- A dedicated mirror heating button with clear iconography (mirror with heating lines)
- Integration into the existing climate control menu with a toggle switch
- Visual indicator showing when mirror heating is active

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

- **Better control**: Users can manually activate mirror heating when specifically needed
- **Improved visibility**: Clear visual feedback when mirror heating is active
- **Enhanced safety**: Better visibility through mirrors during adverse weather conditions
- **User awareness**: Users understand when and how mirror heating functionality works
- **Efficient use**: Ability to use only mirror heating without activating full climate system
