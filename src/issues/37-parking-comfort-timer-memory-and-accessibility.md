## Issue Description

The Parking Comfort Timer setting does not remember the configured value after exiting the vehicle, requiring users to reconfigure it every time they need to use this feature. Additionally, the setting is buried deep in the infotainment menu system, making it difficult to access quickly when needed. The current implementation also lacks flexibility in usage modes - users cannot choose between one-time use or permanent activation.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

- **Memory Loss**: Users must repeatedly navigate through menus to set the same timer value, wasting time and causing frustration
- **Poor Accessibility**: The setting is hidden deep in the menu structure, making it impractical for quick access when needed
- **Limited Flexibility**: No option to choose between temporary (one-time) or permanent activation modes
- **User Experience Degradation**: Particularly problematic for delivery drivers or people who frequently need to briefly exit their vehicle while keeping climate control active
- **Safety Concerns**: Drivers may attempt to navigate complex menus while the vehicle is running or in traffic situations - for users who need to use this feature multiple times daily, the frustration and time loss will lead them to configure it while driving

## Proposed Solution

1. **Memory Persistence**: Make the Parking Comfort Timer remember the last set duration across vehicle sessions
2. **Quick Access Shortcut**: Add a direct shortcut to Parking Comfort Timer settings, accessible from the main climate control screen or through a dedicated button
3. **Usage Mode Selection**: Implement two usage modes:
   - **One-time use**: Timer activates once and then resets to off
   - **Permanent mode**: Timer setting remains active for future use until manually disabled
4. **Smart Context Menu**: Show Parking Comfort Timer option prominently in climate controls when the vehicle is parked

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

- **Improved User Experience**: Elimination of repetitive menu navigation saves time and reduces frustration
- **Enhanced Accessibility**: Quick access makes the feature practical for frequent use
- **Professional Use Support**: Particularly beneficial for delivery drivers, service technicians, and others who frequently exit vehicles briefly
- **Flexibility**: Users can choose the appropriate mode based on their usage patterns
- **Safety Improvement**: Reduced need to navigate complex menus while vehicle is in use
- **Feature Adoption**: More users would likely utilize this feature if it were more accessible and persistent

## Negative Impact of Proposed Solution

- **Battery Consideration**: Persistent timer settings might lead to unintended battery drain if users forget the feature is active
