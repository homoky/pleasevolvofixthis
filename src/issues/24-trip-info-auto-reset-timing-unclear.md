title: "Trip Info Auto-Reset Timing Unclear and Inconsistent"

## Issue Description

In the Trip Info section under Current Trip, there is a settings button with an option for automatic reset. When selecting "after each trip," users expect the system to reset trip information after exiting the vehicle for a reasonable period (ideally around 30 minutes). However, the reset functionality behavior is unpredictable - it's unclear what actually triggers the reset or what the time interval is.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

- Users cannot understand when the reset will actually occur
- There is no transparency about what triggers the reset or the time interval required
- Unpredictable behavior leads to confusion about whether the feature is working properly
- Users cannot rely on consistent trip tracking due to unclear reset logic

## Proposed Solution

1. Fix the automatic reset functionality to work reliably when "after each trip" is selected
2. Clearly communicate the exact time interval (e.g., "30 minutes") in the settings interface
3. Consider adding user-configurable time intervals (15 min, 30 min, 1 hour, etc.)

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

- Users would have reliable and predictable trip information management
- Clear expectations about when resets will occur
- Better user trust in the system's functionality
- More accurate trip tracking and data collection
- Enhanced user control over their vehicle's information systems
