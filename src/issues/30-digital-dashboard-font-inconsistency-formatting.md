## Issue Description

On the digital dashboard, the odometer display (total kilometers driven) uses a different font size compared to the range and remaining battery information. Additionally, the formatting is inconsistent - the odometer shows "23702km" without proper thousand separators and spacing, making it harder to read at a glance.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

- **Poor readability**: The lack of thousand separators makes large numbers difficult to read quickly while driving
- **Visual inconsistency**: Different font sizes create a disjointed appearance on the dashboard
- **Cognitive load**: Drivers need extra mental effort to parse the unseparated number format
- **Professional appearance**: The inconsistent formatting looks unpolished compared to other luxury vehicle displays

## Proposed Solution

Standardize the digital dashboard typography and formatting:

- Use consistent font sizes across all dashboard metrics (odometer, range, battery level)
- Add proper thousand separators to the odometer reading based on locale settings (e.g., "23 702 km" with space separator, or "23,702 km" with comma separator, instead of "23702km")
- Ensure consistent spacing between numbers and units across all metrics
- Maintain the same visual hierarchy and styling for similar types of information

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

- **Improved readability**: Proper formatting makes numbers easier to read at a glance
- **Visual coherence**: Consistent typography creates a more professional, unified dashboard appearance
- **Better user experience**: Reduced cognitive effort required to process dashboard information
- **Safety enhancement**: Faster information processing means less time looking away from the road
- **Brand perception**: Professional formatting reinforces Volvo's premium brand image
