## Issue Description

The Volvo EX30 mobile app currently lacks iOS home screen widgets that would allow users to quickly check essential vehicle information without opening the full application. This means users must launch the complete app every time they want to check basic vehicle status, location, or climate setting.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

- **Time inefficiency**: Users must open the full app and wait for it to load just to check simple status information like battery level or vehicle location
- **Poor user experience**: Multiple taps and app loading time required for basic information that should be instantly accessible
- **Missed convenience**: iOS widgets are a standard feature that users expect from modern vehicle apps, creating a gap in functionality compared to other automotive apps
- **Reduced engagement**: Without quick access to vehicle status, users may check their vehicle less frequently, potentially missing important alerts or status changes

## Proposed Solution

Implement iOS home screen widgets for the Volvo EX30 app with two primary widget types:

### Widget 1: Vehicle Location

- Shows current vehicle position on a small map thumbnail
- Displays address or nearby landmark
- Shows distance in meters from current user location to vehicle
- Quick tap opens full location view in the app

### Widget 2: Vehicle Status Dashboard

- Battery percentage with visual indicator
- Current driving range in kilometers
- Current cabin temperature
- Charging status (if applicable)
- Compact layout suitable for various iOS widget sizes

## Prerequisites

Widgets should:

- Update automatically with fresh vehicle data
- Support multiple widget sizes (small, medium, large)
- Maintain Volvo's design language and branding
- Include appropriate privacy controls and user permissions

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

- **Instant access**: Vehicle status information available directly from iPhone home screen without app launch
- **Better user experience**: Reduces friction for checking common vehicle information from multiple taps to zero taps
- **Enhanced convenience**: Users can quickly glance at widgets to see if car is ready, charged, or at expected location
- **Modern functionality**: Brings the Volvo app in line with user expectations and industry standards for automotive apps
- **Increased user engagement**: Easy access to vehicle status may encourage more frequent monitoring and interaction with vehicle features
- **Time savings**: Eliminates app loading time for basic status checks, especially valuable in quick decision-making scenarios
- **Enhanced brand perception**: iOS users will have higher perception of Volvo brand as it demonstrates care and willingness to go the extra step for customers
