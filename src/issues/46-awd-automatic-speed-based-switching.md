## Issue Description

The EX30's current AWD system lacks an automatic speed-based switching option that would optimize traction and efficiency. Unlike other Volvo models, there is no setting to automatically engage AWD at low speeds (up to 30 km/h) for maximum traction and then switch to RWD only for highway efficiency.

Currently, drivers must manually choose between different driving modes (normal and performance mode) without the benefit of intelligent, speed-based AWD management that adapts to driving conditions automatically.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

The current implementation creates several efficiency and usability issues:

1. **Reduced low-speed traction**: Manual AWD selection may result in reduced traction during critical low-speed situations like parking, starting from stops, or navigating slippery conditions
2. **Inefficient highway driving**: Continuous AWD engagement at higher speeds unnecessarily reduces range and efficiency
3. **Driver workload**: Manual mode switching requires constant attention and decision-making from the driver
4. **Inconsistent with Volvo standards**: Missing a feature that is standard in other Volvo models creates an inconsistent brand experience
5. **Suboptimal safety**: Drivers may forget to engage AWD when conditions require maximum traction

## Proposed Solution

Implement an intelligent speed-based AWD management system:

1. **Automatic low-speed AWD**: Engage AWD automatically from 0-30 km/h for maximum traction during starts, parking, and maneuvering
2. **Seamless transition**: Automatically switch to RWD-only mode above 30 km/h for optimal efficiency during highway driving
3. **Customizable speed threshold**: Allow users to set their preferred AWD switching speed (off, 30 km/h, 50 km/h, or always AWD)
4. **Override capability**: Allow manual AWD engagement regardless of speed when needed for specific conditions
5. **Smart conditions detection**: Consider road conditions, weather data, and driving patterns for more intelligent switching decisions

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

The proposed solution would deliver several benefits:

1. **Optimized efficiency**: Automatic switching maximizes range by using RWD at highway speeds while ensuring traction when needed
2. **Enhanced safety**: Guaranteed AWD engagement during critical low-speed situations improves vehicle control and safety
3. **Reduced driver workload**: Eliminates the need for manual AWD management in most driving scenarios
4. **Volvo brand consistency**: Aligns the EX30 with features available in other Volvo models
5. **Improved user experience**: Seamless operation without sacrificing performance or efficiency
6. **Better traction management**: Ensures optimal traction during parking, starting, low-speed maneuvering, and especially in wet weather conditions

## Negative Impact of Proposed Solution

Potential drawbacks include:

1. **Transition feel**: Some drivers might notice the AWD engagement/disengagement transitions
2. **Edge case handling**: System must properly handle situations like sudden deceleration or acceleration near the switching threshold
