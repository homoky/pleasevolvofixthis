title: "Climate View - Missing Icon Labels"

## Issue Description

In the climate view, unlike all other system views, the icons do not have descriptive labels underneath them. This makes the climate control interface inconsistent with the rest of the infotainment system and potentially confusing for users who are not familiar with the specific icon meanings.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

- **Inconsistent User Interface**: Climate view behaves differently from all other system views, breaking interface consistency
- **Reduced Usability**: Users must guess or memorize what each icon represents without helpful text labels
- **Learning Curve**: New users or infrequent drivers need time to understand the meaning of unlabeled icons
- **Accessibility Issues**: Less accessible for users who might benefit from text labels to understand functionality
- **Driver Distraction**: Users may spend more time trying to identify the correct icon while driving

## Proposed Solution

Add descriptive text labels underneath each climate control icon, consistent with the labeling approach used in all other system views.

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

- **Interface Consistency**: Climate view will match the design pattern used throughout the rest of the system
- **Improved Usability**: Users can quickly identify functions without relying solely on icon recognition
- **Enhanced Accessibility**: Text labels make the interface more accessible to all users
- **Reduced Learning Time**: New users can immediately understand available functions

## Negative Impact of Proposed Solution

- **Increased Visual Density**: Additional text may make the climate view appear more cluttered
- **Potential Space Constraints**: Labels might require interface layout adjustments to accommodate text
