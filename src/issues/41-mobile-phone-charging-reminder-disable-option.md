## Issue Description

When putting the car in parking mode while using the wireless charging pad, the infotainment system displays a reminder popup about not forgetting to take the mobile phone from the charger. This popup appears every time without any option to permanently dismiss or disable the notification.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

The repetitive reminder popup creates an unnecessary interruption for drivers who:

- Use their phone as a digital key and are already highly aware they need to take it when exiting
- Find the constant reminder annoying and intrusive
- Want a cleaner, less cluttered interface when parking
- Are experienced with wireless charging and don't need ongoing reminders

The lack of dismissal options forces all users to see this popup regardless of their experience level or personal preferences.

## Proposed Solution

Add a "Don't show again" checkbox or toggle option to the mobile phone charging reminder popup, allowing users to permanently disable this notification.

The implementation could include:

- A checkbox labeled "Don't show this reminder again" within the popup
- Clear indication that the reminder can be re-enabled through settings if needed
- Maintain the popup as default behavior for new users who benefit from the reminder

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

Implementing a disable option would:

- Significantly improve user experience for drivers who find the popup intrusive
- Provide customization options that respect user preferences and experience levels
- Reduce interface clutter for experienced users
- Maintain helpful guidance for new users while allowing dismissal for experienced ones
- Create a more personalized and less annoying infotainment experience

## Negative Impact of Proposed Solution

Potential drawbacks could include:

- Risk that users might accidentally disable the reminder and later forget their phone
- Additional complexity in the notification system settings
- Possible confusion about where to re-enable the reminder if needed later
