## Issue Description

The Volvo infotainment system currently lacks integration with smart garage door systems, requiring drivers to use separate devices or manual controls to operate their garage doors. Modern smart homes commonly use HTTP-based garage door controllers that could be integrated into the vehicle's interface.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

Drivers must juggle multiple devices when arriving home - steering the vehicle while simultaneously reaching for garage door remotes, smartphone apps, or other controllers. This creates distraction and reduces convenience, especially when returning home with hands full or during bad weather conditions. The lack of location-based automation means missing opportunities for seamless smart home integration.

## Proposed Solution

Implement a comprehensive garage door control system in the infotainment interface with the following features:

- **HTTP Integration**: Support for garage door controllers via HTTP requests with authentication (API keys, tokens, basic auth)
- **Multiple Garage Configuration**: Allow setup of multiple garage doors with individual settings and names
- **Location-Based Triggers**: Set GPS coordinates for each garage, automatically showing popup controls when approaching
- **Automatic Operation**: Optional fully automatic door opening when arriving at configured locations
- **Manual Controls**: On-demand garage door controls accessible through the infotainment menu
- **Provider Flexibility**: While HTTP webhooks provide broad compatibility, explore integration with major smart home platforms (HomeKit, Google Home, Alexa) for wider ecosystem support
- **HomeLink Integration**: If Volvo adds HomeLink support to their vehicles (as an optional feature like Tesla or Audi offer), this could serve as an additional provider option, giving users choice between traditional HomeLink and modern HTTP-based solutions

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

- Significantly improves the home arrival experience by reducing driver distraction and increasing convenience
- Location-based automation ensures garage doors open seamlessly without manual intervention
- Supporting multiple garages accommodates users with complex home setups or multiple properties
- HTTP-based integration provides compatibility with most modern garage door systems
- Potential smart home platform integration could expand compatibility even further
- Adds premium functionality and technological sophistication that is uncommon in most vehicles, enhancing the overall value proposition

## Negative Impact of Proposed Solution

- Location-based automation could trigger accidentally in nearby areas, requiring precise GPS calibration
- Users would need technical knowledge to configure HTTP endpoints and authentication
- Privacy concerns arise from storing location data and network credentials in the vehicle system
