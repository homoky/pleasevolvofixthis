title: "Media Pause on Driver Door Open - Optional Setting"

## Issue Description

The car currently continues playing media when the driver's door is opened, which is actually a thoughtful design choice compared to many vehicles that abruptly stop playback. However, some users prefer the traditional behavior of pausing media when exiting the vehicle, and there's currently no setting to customize this behavior.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

The current fixed behavior creates user preference conflicts:

- Some drivers appreciate the continuous playback when briefly stepping out of the vehicle
- Other users find it annoying that music continues playing when they exit, potentially draining battery or disturbing others
- No accommodation for different user preferences or use cases
- Users who prefer media to pause have no option to customize this behavior

## Proposed Solution

Add a setting in the infotainment system under "Audio" or "General" settings:

- **"Media behavior when driver door opens"** dropdown with three options:
  - **Continue playing** (default): Current behavior is maintained (media continues playing)
  - **Pause**: Media playback pauses automatically when driver door is opened
  - **Lower volume**: Media volume automatically reduces to a lower level (e.g., 20% of current volume) when driver door opens

This setting should be easily accessible and clearly labeled to help users understand the impact of their choice.

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

This optional setting would:

- Accommodate both user preferences without forcing a one-size-fits-all solution
- Maintain the current thoughtful design as the default while providing choice
- Reduce user complaints about unwanted continued playback
- Allow users to customize behavior based on their typical usage patterns
- Provide flexibility for different scenarios (brief stops vs. longer exits)
