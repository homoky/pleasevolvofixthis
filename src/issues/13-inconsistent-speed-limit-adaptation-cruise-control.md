## Issue Description

The cruise control system inconsistently adapts to new speed limits despite having the speed limit adaptation setting enabled. When entering a new speed zone (e.g., transitioning from a higher speed zone to a 50 km/h zone), the system sometimes adjusts the cruise control speed automatically and sometimes does not, even though the new speed limit is clearly detected and displayed on the screen next to the current cruise control limit and speed.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

- Unpredictable cruise control behavior creates inconsistent driving experience
- Driver cannot rely on the automatic speed adaptation feature even when it's enabled
- Requires constant manual monitoring and adjustment of cruise control settings
- Forces driver to manually override cruise control speed when automatic adaptation fails
- When entering a village at illegal speed, driver must manually brake, which disables cruise control entirely
- Reduces confidence in the driver assistance system's reliability
- The feature becomes unreliable despite being specifically enabled for this purpose

## Proposed Solution

Improve the speed limit detection and adaptation logic to ensure consistent behavior when the speed limit adaptation setting is enabled. The system should:

- Always adapt cruise control speed when a new speed limit is detected and displayed
- Provide clear and consistent criteria for when speed adaptation occurs
- Ensure the adaptation works regardless of road type, time of day, or speed difference

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

- Increased driver confidence in the driver assistance system
- Reduced need for manual cruise control adjustments
- Better utilization of the existing speed limit detection technology
- Enhanced overall driving experience with more consistent automation
- Improved safety through more reliable speed management

## Negative Impact of Proposed Solution

- May require extensive testing and calibration of the speed detection algorithms
- Could potentially result in unwanted speed changes if detection becomes too sensitive
- Might need additional user settings to fine-tune adaptation behavior for different preferences
