## Issue Description

The current minimum brightness setting for the infotainment display is still too bright for comfortable night driving. Even when set to the lowest available brightness level, the display produces excessive light that causes glare and reduces night vision capability.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

- **Night vision impairment**: Excessive display brightness reduces driver's ability to see clearly outside the vehicle in dark conditions
- **Eye strain and fatigue**: Bright display light causes discomfort during extended night driving sessions
- **Glare and distraction**: Overly bright screen creates unwanted reflections on windows and mirrors
- **Safety concerns**: Reduced night vision capability can impact ability to spot pedestrians, animals, or road hazards
- **Driver discomfort**: Many drivers find themselves squinting or looking away from the display due to brightness levels

## Proposed Solution

Extend the brightness range to include much lower minimum settings:

- Reduce minimum brightness to the absolute lowest value the display hardware can support

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

- **Improved night vision**: Dramatically reduced display brightness allows eyes to maintain better adaptation to darkness
- **Enhanced driving safety**: Better visibility of road conditions, pedestrians, and potential hazards in low-light situations
- **Reduced eye strain**: Comfortable display brightness eliminates squinting and eye fatigue during night driving
- **Better sleep preparation**: Lower light exposure helps maintain natural circadian rhythms for drivers
- **Customizable experience**: Users can find their optimal comfort level for different lighting conditions
