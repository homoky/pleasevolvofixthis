## Issue Description

The climate control temperature popup for driver and passenger settings has empty space on the right side that could be utilized for additional controls. Currently, users must navigate to separate menus to adjust fan speed settings, making climate control less efficient and accessible.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

- Requires multiple screen interactions to adjust both temperature and fan speed
- Empty space in the popup interface is wasted
- Less intuitive climate control experience compared to traditional automotive interfaces
- Increased driver distraction due to multiple menu navigation while driving
- Slower response time when quick climate adjustments are needed

## Proposed Solution

Add fan speed control options (Auto, Off, Low, Medium, High) in the empty right-hand space of the temperature adjustment popup. This would create a unified climate control interface where both temperature and fan speed can be adjusted simultaneously without leaving the popup.

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

- Single-screen access to primary climate controls reduces driver distraction
- More efficient use of available screen real estate
- Faster climate adjustments with fewer menu interactions
- More intuitive interface that matches user expectations from traditional car controls
- Improved safety through reduced time spent navigating menus while driving

## Negative Impact of Proposed Solution

- Slightly more crowded popup interface, though there appears to be adequate space
- Potential for accidental fan speed changes when adjusting temperature
- May require interface redesign to maintain visual balance and readability
