## Issue Description

The EX30 currently lacks the ability to configure custom side mirror positions for reverse gear. When reversing, the mirrors cannot be adjusted to automatically tilt down to show the ground and wheel area, which is a standard feature in vehicles of this price category.

The current mirror adjustment system only allows manual positioning for normal driving, with no option to enable or configure automatic reverse positioning for improved visibility while backing up.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

The absence of reverse mirror positioning creates several safety and usability concerns:

1. **Reduced parking visibility**: Drivers cannot see the ground or curb position relative to their wheels when reversing
2. **Increased risk of wheel damage**: Without proper ground visibility, drivers are more likely to scrape wheels against curbs or obstacles
3. **Safety concerns for non-360 camera users**: Vehicles without the 360-degree camera system have limited visibility aids while reversing
4. **Missing expected feature**: This functionality is standard equipment in competing vehicles at this price point
5. **Manual mirror adjustment distraction**: Drivers must manually adjust mirrors while reversing, taking attention away from driving

## Proposed Solution

Implement a comprehensive side mirror reverse position management system:

1. **Toggle option**: Add a setting to enable/disable automatic mirror positioning when engaging reverse gear
2. **"Manage" button**: Add a dedicated management interface for reverse mirror settings
3. **Position memory**: Allow users to set and save preferred mirror positions for reverse gear
4. **Smart transition system**: Automatically switch smoothly between reverse and drive mirror positions based on driving mode
5. **Low-speed positioning**: Maintain reverse mirror position during forward movement up to 5 km/h to assist with maneuvering

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

The proposed solution would provide several benefits:

1. **Enhanced safety**: Better ground visibility reduces the risk of accidents and property damage
2. **Improved parking confidence**: Drivers can park more precisely and safely, especially in tight spaces
3. **Reduced wheel damage**: Clear visibility of wheel position relative to curbs and obstacles
4. **Competitive feature parity**: Brings the EX30 in line with standard features expected in this price category and maintains Volvo's reputation for comprehensive safety features
5. **Better user experience**: Automated mirror adjustment eliminates the need for manual repositioning while reversing
6. **Accessibility improvement**: Particularly beneficial for drivers who struggle with spatial awareness or have limited mobility
