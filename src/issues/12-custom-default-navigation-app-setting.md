## Issue Description

Currently, the infotainment system defaults to Google Maps when accessing navigation. Users cannot set their preferred navigation app (such as Waze or other Google Play Store navigation apps) as the default option. Every time you press the home button, only Google Maps is visible as the primary navigation choice.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

- Users must manually navigate through the app selection menu every time they want to use their preferred navigation app
- Forces users to take extra steps (home button → app selection → choose preferred nav app) instead of direct access
- Creates unnecessary interaction time while driving, potentially affecting safety
- Reduces user satisfaction by not respecting personal app preferences

## Proposed Solution

Add a setting in the system preferences that allows users to select their default navigation application from available navigation apps installed from Google Play Store. This setting would include options for:

- Google Maps (current default)
- Waze
- Other compatible navigation applications currently installed

The setting would be located in the system settings menu, similar to how smartphones allow users to set default apps for various functions.

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

- Immediate access to preferred navigation app with single button press
- Reduced driver distraction and improved safety through fewer required interactions
- Enhanced user experience by respecting individual preferences
- No impact on users who prefer to keep the current default (Google Maps)
- Maintains system stability while adding user customization

## Negative Impact of Proposed Solution

- Minimal risk of user confusion during initial setup, though this would be mitigated by clear settings interface
- Could potentially require validation of third-party navigation apps for compatibility
