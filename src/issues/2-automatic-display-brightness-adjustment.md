## Issue Description

The infotainment display brightness does not automatically adjust based on external lighting conditions. Users must manually adjust brightness settings throughout the day - when set to minimum for night driving, the display becomes barely visible during bright daylight conditions the next day.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

- **Constant manual adjustment required**: Drivers must repeatedly adjust brightness settings as lighting conditions change throughout the day
- **Poor visibility in bright conditions**: Display set to minimum brightness for night driving becomes hard to read in daylight
- **Safety distraction**: Manual brightness adjustments while driving take attention away from the road
- **Eye strain**: Sudden brightness changes when switching between day/night settings can cause discomfort

## Proposed Solution

Implement automatic brightness adjustment that:

- Uses ambient light sensors to detect external lighting conditions
- Automatically adjusts display brightness in real-time based on environmental light levels
- Provides smooth transitions between brightness levels to avoid jarring changes
- Allows users to set manual override when desired
- Includes user-configurable sensitivity settings for personal preference
- Maintains separate brightness profiles for day and night conditions with smooth transitions
- Uses user-defined day and night brightness settings as milestones, with automatic adjustment operating within these boundaries

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

- **Enhanced safety**: Eliminates need for manual brightness adjustments while driving
- **Optimal visibility**: Display automatically maintains appropriate brightness for current conditions
- **Improved user experience**: Set-and-forget functionality reduces driver workload
- **Better eye comfort**: Smooth automatic transitions prevent sudden brightness changes
- **Consistent readability**: Display remains clearly visible in all lighting conditions without user intervention
- **Modern functionality**: Brings the infotainment system in line with smartphone and tablet auto-brightness features
