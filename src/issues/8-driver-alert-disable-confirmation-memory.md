title: "Driver Alert Disable - Remember User Confirmation"

## Issue Description

When disabling Driver Alert features, the system displays an unnecessary confirmation notification that requires an extra click each time. This confirmation appears every time the user wants to turn off Driver Alert, even though the user has already demonstrated understanding of the action by repeatedly disabling it.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

- **Repetitive Interruption**: Users must confirm the same action repeatedly, causing frustration
- **Unnecessary Friction**: Extra click required for a simple toggle action that should be immediate
- **Poor User Experience**: System doesn't learn or remember user preferences and understanding
- **Distraction While Driving**: Additional interaction required that could divert attention from the road
- **Counterproductive Safety**: The intended safety feature actually creates more risk by requiring extra steps while driving

## Proposed Solution

Add a "Remember my choice" or "Don't show this again" option to the Driver Alert disable confirmation dialog. Once the user checks this option and confirms, the system should:

1. Remember the user's preference to skip future confirmations per individual driver profile
2. Allow direct toggling of Driver Alert without showing the confirmation dialog for users who opted to remember
3. Store this preference in individual user profile settings (not globally)
4. Continue showing confirmations for driver profiles that haven't opted to remember the choice
5. Optionally provide a way to reset this preference in the individual profile settings menu

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

- **Streamlined User Experience**: Direct toggle functionality without repetitive confirmations
- **Reduced Driver Distraction**: Fewer clicks means less time interacting with the screen
- **Intelligent System Behavior**: System learns and adapts to user preferences
- **Improved Efficiency**: Faster access to frequently used settings
- **User Autonomy**: Respects user's demonstrated understanding of the feature

## Negative Impact of Proposed Solution

- **Potential Accidental Disabling**: Some users might accidentally disable Driver Alert without the safety confirmation
- **Hidden Safety Feature**: Less prominent warning about disabling safety features
