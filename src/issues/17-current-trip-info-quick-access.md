## Issue Description

While driving, there is no easily accessible way to view current consumption (kWh) and distance traveled without navigating through multiple menu layers. Currently, to check consumption when someone asks about it (as it's a new car), drivers must go through Car → Car Status → Trip Info, which requires multiple taps and attention away from driving.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

- **Safety concern**: Requires multiple menu navigation steps while driving, taking attention away from the road
- **Inconvenient access**: Essential driving information is buried in submenus
- **Frequent need**: As EX30 owners often get asked about consumption due to the car being new, this information is needed regularly
- **Distraction**: The current multi-step process creates unnecessary driver distraction

## Proposed Solution

Add current trip information to the top section of the main interface, or enhance the existing quick actions at the bottom with a "Drive Info" button (more in issue #20). When the Drive Info button is pressed, the quick action icons would temporarily disappear and be replaced with current trip information including:

- Current consumption (kWh/100km or similar)
- Distance traveled on current trip
- Average consumption for the trip

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

- **Improved safety**: One-tap access reduces driver distraction and time spent navigating menus
- **Better user experience**: Essential driving information becomes immediately accessible
- **Informed driving**: Easy access to consumption data helps drivers understand their driving efficiency
- **Convenience**: No more multi-step navigation for frequently needed information
- **Social benefit**: Enables quick answers to common questions about the new EV without complex menu navigation

## Negative Impact of Proposed Solution

- **Screen space**: May reduce available space for other interface elements
- **Information overload**: Could potentially clutter the interface if not implemented thoughtfully
- **Learning curve**: Users would need to discover and learn the new quick access method
