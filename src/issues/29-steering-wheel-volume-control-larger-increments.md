## Issue Description

The steering wheel volume controls currently adjust volume in very small increments, requiring multiple button presses to achieve a meaningful change in volume level. Users must repeatedly click the volume buttons to significantly increase or decrease the volume, which is inconvenient during driving.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

- **Driver distraction**: Multiple button presses required to adjust volume significantly
- **Inefficient interaction**: Time-consuming to reach desired volume level
- **Safety concern**: Extended interaction time with controls while driving
- **User frustration**: Simple volume adjustment becomes tedious task
- **Frequent adjustment annoyance**: Particularly frustrating for users who need to change volume often during their drive

## Proposed Solution

Increase the volume increment steps for steering wheel controls to larger units (e.g., 10-20 volume levels per button press instead of current single level). This would allow users to quickly reach their desired volume with fewer button presses while maintaining the fine control option on the display touchscreen for precise adjustments.

**Alternative enhancement**: Implement progressive increment scaling when pressing repeatedly - first press could change by 5 levels, second by 10, third by 20, and subsequent presses by 20 (e.g., 5, 10, 20, 20, 20...) for even more efficient volume adjustment.

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

- **Faster volume adjustment**: Fewer button presses needed for significant volume changes
- **Reduced driver distraction**: Quicker interaction with steering wheel controls
- **Improved safety**: Less time spent adjusting volume while driving
- **Better user experience**: More efficient and intuitive volume control
- **Dual control approach**: Quick adjustment on steering wheel, fine-tuning on display
