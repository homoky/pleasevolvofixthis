title: "One Pedal Drive - Adjustable Braking Intensity Settings"

## Issue Description

The One Pedal Drive feature currently only offers an on/off toggle without any customization options for braking intensity. Drivers cannot adjust how aggressively the regenerative braking engages when lifting off the accelerator pedal, limiting the feature's adaptability to different driving preferences and conditions.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

The current binary on/off approach forces drivers to choose between standard driving mode and a fixed One Pedal Drive experience that may feel too aggressive or too mild for their preferences.

This can lead to:

- Discomfort for drivers who find the current braking intensity too strong or too weak
- Reduced adoption of the feature due to lack of customization
- Inconsistent driving experience that doesn't adapt to different traffic conditions or driver comfort levels
- Potential safety concerns if drivers are uncomfortable with the fixed braking behavior

## Proposed Solution

Add adjustable braking intensity settings for One Pedal Drive with multiple levels (e.g., Low, Medium, High, or a slider scale from 1-10).

This would allow drivers to:

- Fine-tune the regenerative braking strength to match their driving style
- Adjust the setting based on driving conditions (city vs. highway driving)
- Gradually adapt to One Pedal Drive by starting with lower intensity settings
- Maintain consistent energy recovery while customizing the driving feel

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

Implementing adjustable braking intensity would:

- Increase user satisfaction and adoption of the One Pedal Drive feature
- Provide a more personalized driving experience tailored to individual preferences
- Allow drivers to optimize energy recovery based on their comfort level
- Improve overall driving confidence and control
- Enable gradual learning curve for new One Pedal Drive users

## Negative Impact of Proposed Solution

- Increased complexity in the infotainment menu system
- Possible confusion for some users with too many customization options
