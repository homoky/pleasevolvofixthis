## Issue Description

The right steering stalk in the Volvo EX30 serves dual purposes: gear selection when stationary (D, R, P) and cruise control activation/deactivation while driving (down second position). However, once cruise control is active, speed adjustments must be made using the left hand via steering wheel buttons or the touchscreen display. This creates an inconsistent and less intuitive control scheme where the same stalk that activates cruise control cannot be used to adjust its speed.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

- **Inconsistent Control Logic**: The right stalk activates cruise control but cannot adjust its speed, forcing drivers to use different controls
- **Left Hand Dependency**: Speed adjustments require using the left hand on steering wheel buttons, disrupting natural driving ergonomics
- **Reduced Efficiency**: Drivers must switch between different control methods and hands for related cruise control functions - activating with the right hand while adjusting speed with the left hand
- **Cognitive Load**: Having to remember different control locations for cruise control activation vs. adjustment increases mental effort - steering wheel buttons are harder to locate and require more attention than the easily accessible stalk
- **Safety Concern**: Reaching for steering wheel buttons or touchscreen while maintaining cruise control can be less safe than using the natural right stalk position

## Proposed Solution

Add an optional setting to enhance the right steering stalk functionality during active cruise control to allow speed adjustments. This feature should be configurable in vehicle settings to avoid confusing less experienced drivers:

- **Stalk Up**: Increase cruise control speed in small increments (e.g., 5-10 km/h per movement)
- **Stalk Down (first position)**: Decrease cruise control speed in small increments
- **Stalk Down (second position)**: Maintain current function - deactivate cruise control entirely
- Preserve existing functionality when stationary (gear selection) and initial cruise control activation
- **Optional Setting**: Allow drivers to enable/disable this enhanced stalk behavior in vehicle settings, defaulting to current behavior for familiarity

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

- **Unified Control Interface**: All cruise control functions accessible through the same stalk that activates the system
- **Improved Ergonomics**: Natural right-hand control for both activation and speed adjustment
- **Enhanced Safety**: Reduced need to reach for other controls while maintaining speed control
- **Intuitive Operation**: Logical up/down movements for speed increase/decrease
- **Consistent User Experience**: Single control point for all cruise control operations
- **Reduced Learning Curve**: Simplified control scheme that follows natural expectations

## Negative Impact of Proposed Solution

- **Accidental Speed Changes**: Unintentional stalk movements could inadvertently adjust cruise control speed
- **Muscle Memory Disruption**: Existing users would need to adapt to the enhanced functionality
- **Potential Sensitivity Issues**: Finding the right balance between responsive speed adjustment and accidental activation
