## Issue Description

In all graphics and interface elements where vehicle photos are displayed, the system shows generic vehicle images instead of images that match the specific configuration of the owner's vehicle. This includes color, sunroof presence/absence, and other visual features that are already rendered in the vehicle configurator.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

The current generic vehicle imagery creates a disconnect between the user's actual vehicle and what they see in the infotainment system. This reduces the personal connection to the vehicle and makes the interface feel less tailored to the individual owner's specific configuration and choices.

## Proposed Solution

Utilize the existing rendered vehicle images from the configurator to display the user's specific vehicle configuration throughout the infotainment system. This includes:

- Using the correct exterior color in all vehicle graphics
- Showing the presence or absence of the sunroof based on the owner's configuration
- Displaying other visual configuration elements that are already available in the configurator system
- Applying these personalized images consistently across all interface elements that show the vehicle

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

Implementing vehicle-specific imagery would:

- Create a more personalized and engaging user experience
- Strengthen the emotional connection between the owner and their vehicle
- Demonstrate attention to detail and customization
- Make better use of existing configurator technology and assets
- Provide visual consistency between the purchase/configuration experience and daily use
