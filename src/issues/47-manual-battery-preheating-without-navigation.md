## Issue Description

Currently, the Volvo EX30 only allows battery preheating when a charging station is selected through the built-in navigation system. This requires an active WiFi connection, which forces users to manually share internet from their phone, causing CarPlay to disconnect. Users cannot manually initiate battery preheating for optimal charging preparation without this navigation dependency.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

- **Slower Charging**: Without preheating, charging speeds are significantly reduced, especially in cold weather conditions
- **Battery Degradation**: Charging a cold battery causes more stress and long-term damage to battery cells
- **CarPlay Interruption**: Sharing WiFi from phone to enable navigation-based preheating disconnects CarPlay, disrupting music, calls, and navigation
- **WiFi Dependency**: Requires manual hotspot setup every time, adding unnecessary complexity to the charging preparation process
- **Inconvenience**: Users must choose between optimal charging performance and maintaining their preferred infotainment interface
- **Competitive Disadvantage**: Other electric vehicles offer simple manual battery preheating options without navigation dependencies

## Proposed Solution

Add a dedicated "Preheat Battery for Charging" button that initiates the battery preheating process before charging. This button should be easily accessible in the main menu or climate control section and work independently of navigation system and WiFi connectivity, allowing users to prepare the battery for optimal charging while maintaining their preferred connectivity setup.

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

- **Faster Charging**: Properly preheated battery achieves maximum charging speeds from the start
- **CarPlay Compatibility**: Users can maintain CarPlay connection while preparing for optimal charging
- **User Convenience**: Simple one-touch battery preparation without complex navigation setup
- **Competitive Parity**: Matches functionality available in other electric vehicles
- **Improved User Experience**: Removes artificial barriers between charging optimization and infotainment preferences

## Negative Impact of Proposed Solution

- **Battery Drain**: Manual preheating could drain battery if used unnecessarily when not planning to charge
- **User Education**: Requires users to understand when battery preheating is beneficial vs. wasteful
- **Potential Overuse**: Users might activate preheating habitually even when not needed, reducing overall efficiency
