## Issue Description

The predictive collision warning system has three settings: "Early", "Medium", and "Late". However, even the "Early" setting provides warnings too late to be truly effective for preventing collisions.

## Current Behavior

- Three available settings: Early, Medium, Late
- "Early" setting still triggers warnings at a point where reaction time may be insufficient
- Limited effectiveness in preventing potential accidents

## Suggested Solution

Add an "Extra Early" or "Maximum" setting that provides warnings even sooner than the current "Early" setting, giving drivers more time to react to potential collision scenarios.

## Impact

- **Safety**: Enhanced collision avoidance capabilities
- **User Experience**: Better customization for different driving preferences and reaction times
- **Peace of Mind**: Increased confidence in the safety system's effectiveness

This enhancement would make the forward collision warning system more robust and adaptable to various driving conditions and user preferences.
