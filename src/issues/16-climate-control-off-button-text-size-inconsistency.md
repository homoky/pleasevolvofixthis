title: "Climate Control Off Button Text Size Inconsistency"

## Issue Description

The climate control quick access panel displays text that is disproportionately large compared to other interface elements. This affects both the "OFF" button and temperature display values (e.g., "23°C") for driver and passenger zones, creating visual inconsistency and unprofessional appearance that doesn't align with the rest of the infotainment system's design language.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

The oversized text for climate control elements ("OFF" button and temperature values) creates several issues:

- Makes the interface appear amateurish and poorly designed
- Creates visual inconsistency within the climate control interface
- Reduces readability, especially while driving
- Breaks the cohesive design pattern established throughout the system
- Suggests lack of attention to detail in the UI design

## Proposed Solution

Standardize the text size for all climate control elements including the "OFF" button and temperature display values (e.g., "23°C") to match other interface elements. The text should use consistent font size, weight, and styling as other interactive elements throughout the infotainment system to maintain visual harmony.

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

- Creates a more professional and polished appearance
- Improves visual consistency across the climate control interface
- Enhances readability and user experience
- Maintains design coherence with the rest of the infotainment system
- Demonstrates attention to detail and quality in UI design
