title: "Proximity Warning Audio - Redundant Second Alert"

## Issue Description

The collision warning audio alert system plays a two-part warning when there's a risk of collision during normal driving, such as with vehicles ahead, cyclists, or other road hazards. The audio warning consists of two sequential alerts, but the second part is redundant and occurs too late to be useful for collision avoidance.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

The second audio warning plays at a time when contact with the vehicle or object would have already occurred, making it ineffective for preventing collisions. This delayed second warning can be confusing to drivers and creates unnecessary audio clutter in the cabin. The redundant alert may also cause drivers to lose confidence in the proximity warning system's accuracy and timing.

## Proposed Solution

Simplify the collision warning audio system to play only a single, well-timed alert when collision risk is detected. The warning should be quick, sharp, and moderately aggressive to immediately alert the driver, distinctly different from other gentle vehicle sounds.

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

A single, properly timed audio warning would provide clearer and more actionable feedback to drivers. This would improve the effectiveness of the collision avoidance system by eliminating confusion from redundant alerts. Drivers would have better confidence in the warning system's timing and would be more likely to respond appropriately to the alerts.
