## Issue Description

The infotainment display remains too bright even when brightness is set to minimum, causing eye strain and discomfort during night driving. There is currently no option to completely turn off the display while maintaining audio functionality and safety features.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

- **Eye strain and discomfort**: Even at minimum brightness, the display emits too much light in dark conditions, causing physical discomfort and eye fatigue
- **Distraction from road**: The bright display draws attention away from the road ahead during night driving
- **Compromised night vision**: Constant bright light exposure affects the driver's ability to see clearly in dark environments
- **Safety concerns**: Eye strain and distraction can lead to reduced driving performance and increased accident risk

## Proposed Solution

Implement a complete display shutdown feature that:

- Allows users to turn off the display entirely with a dedicated button or gesture
- Maintains all audio functions (music, navigation voice prompts, alerts) without visual display
- Preserves all safety-critical audio warnings and notifications
- Navigation voice commands continue to work without turning the display back on
- Display can only be reactivated by touching the screen again
- No automatic display activation from any system except direct user touch

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

- **Enhanced safety**: Reduced eye strain and distraction leads to better focus on road conditions
- **Improved comfort**: Elimination of unwanted light sources during night driving
- **Better night vision**: Preserves natural night vision adaptation by removing bright light sources
- **Maintained functionality**: All essential audio features continue to work seamlessly
- **User control**: Gives drivers full control over their visual environment while driving
- **Reduced fatigue**: Less eye strain results in reduced overall driving fatigue on long night trips

## Negative Impact of Proposed Solution

- **Speed visibility**: Users would not be able to see their current speed on the display when it's turned off. However, this is not a significant concern since drivers who choose not to look at the display would not see the speed information anyway, regardless of whether the display is on or off.
