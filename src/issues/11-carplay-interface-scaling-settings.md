## Issue Description

The CarPlay interface scaling/zoom level is not optimized for the EX30's display resolution. Interface elements appear oversized, making poor use of the available screen real estate. The dashboard view with map integration is particularly affected and nearly unusable due to excessive scaling.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

- Limited information visible on screen due to oversized interface elements
- Dashboard map view provides insufficient detail and navigation context
- Interface appears unprofessional and cheap due to poor scaling optimization
- Reduced usability when trying to interact with CarPlay applications
- Wasted potential of the display's good resolution capabilities

## Proposed Solution

Volvo should implement proper CarPlay scaling settings within the integration configuration.

This could include:

- Adjustable scaling/zoom levels in the infotainment settings
- Optimized default scaling that better utilizes the display resolution
- Better integration settings that respect the native display capabilities

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

- More information and detail visible on the display
- Improved map visibility and navigation experience in dashboard view
- More professional and premium appearance of the interface
- Better utilization of the high-quality display hardware
- Enhanced overall CarPlay usability and user experience

## Negative Impact of Proposed Solution

- May require users to adjust settings to their preference initially
- Could provide multiple scaling options (50%, 75%, 100%, 125%) to accommodate different user preferences and accessibility needs
