## Issue Description

The Pilot Assist system offers three time interval settings for following distance: "Short", "Medium", and "Long". However, even the "Short" setting maintains an extremely large gap to the vehicle ahead, particularly problematic during highway driving where other vehicles frequently merge into this space.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

- **Safety hazard**: Other cars constantly merge into the large gap on highways, creating unpredictable, dangerous driving situations
- **Counterproductive safety feature**: What is intended as a safety feature actually endangers the driver and passengers by creating dangerous situations when impatient drivers from other vehicles aggressively merge into the large gap
- **Driver stress**: Continuous merging activity forces the driver to deal with frequent lane changes and traffic disruptions
- **System ineffectiveness**: The adaptive cruise control becomes less reliable when the following distance is too conservative for real-world highway conditions
- **Traffic flow disruption**: Excessively large gaps can contribute to traffic congestion and inefficient highway utilization

## Proposed Solution

Adjust the default values for the existing "Short", "Medium", and "Long" following distance settings to provide more appropriate gaps for real-world highway conditions. Volvo should take inspiration from other automotive manufacturers like Audi, whose adaptive cruise control systems offer more reasonable following distances.

The adjusted settings should:

- Reduce the following distance for all three settings, particularly the "Short" setting
- Benchmark against competitors like Audi to ensure following distances are competitive and practical
- Maintain safe but reasonable gaps that discourage frequent merging by other vehicles
- Still provide adequate stopping distance and reaction time for each setting level
- Better match driver expectations for what "Short", "Medium", and "Long" following distances should actually be

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

- **Enhanced safety**: Fewer merge attempts into the following distance reduces unpredictable traffic situations
- **Improved driver confidence**: More predictable traffic flow around the vehicle increases trust in the system
- **Better highway efficiency**: More appropriate following distances contribute to smoother traffic flow
- **Reduced driver intervention**: Less need for manual adjustments when other vehicles merge into the gap
- **Better user experience**: The existing settings will more accurately reflect their intended purpose
