## Issue Description

The current range estimation system in the Volvo EX30 provides inaccurate projections that are consistently lower than the actual achievable range. The system doesn't appear to take into account individual driving patterns, route characteristics, or real-time driving behavior when calculating the expected range. It seems the system intentionally underestimates range to create a "better user experience" with remaining range, but this actually creates stress when drivers trust these conservative estimates and make unnecessary charging decisions.

## Negative Impact of Current Solution

The inaccurate range estimation causes unnecessary range anxiety and affects trip planning confidence. Drivers cannot rely on the displayed range for accurate journey planning, leading to:

- Unnecessary charging stops due to overly conservative estimates
- Reduced confidence in the vehicle's actual capabilities
- Poor user experience and trust in the infotainment system
- Suboptimal route planning decisions

## Proposed Solution

Implement a personalized range estimation system that uses:

- Individual driver's historical consumption data and driving patterns
- Current trip characteristics and route profile (when navigation is active)
- Real-time driving style analysis (acceleration, braking, speed patterns)
- Route topology, traffic conditions, and weather data
- Learning algorithms that adapt to the specific driver's behavior over time

The system should maintain a driver profile that continuously learns and refines range predictions based on actual vs. predicted consumption data.

## Positive Impact of Proposed Solution

- More accurate range predictions leading to better trip planning
- Reduced range anxiety through realistic and personalized estimates
- Improved confidence in the vehicle's capabilities
- Better utilization of the vehicle's actual range potential
- Enhanced user experience and trust in the infotainment system
- More efficient charging behavior and route planning
